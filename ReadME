Implemented distance vector routing protocol called RIP where each router exchanges its routing information with the neighbors 
and based on this exchange it computes the shortest path from itself to all other routers.

Steps:

1) First input the value of current Ip Address.
2) Now input the neighbors ipAddress along with the cost for the current router.
3) Repeat the steps in all the instances to make the topology.
